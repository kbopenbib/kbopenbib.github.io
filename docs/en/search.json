The joint endeavour is pursuing four subsequent sub-goals:\n\nDatabase provision: Provision of a free and machine-readable developer instance of the bibliometric database OpenAlex as a basis for curating German publication data using an open licence.\nDatabase comparison: Comparative analysis of the coverage and quality of the open bibliometric database OpenAlex compared to the proprietary databases (Culbert et al. 2024).\nData curation: Development and application of technical procedures for curating the metadata of publications produced with the participation of authors from German research institutions.\nNetworking and usage: Identification of national and international re-use opportunities."
